Competition Checklist:
- [ ] title of this PR is meaningful, i.e. "method X for comp"
- [ ] A folder has been added to `submission/` with a meaningful name corresponding to your method name.
- The added folder includes these elements:
    - [ ] `metadata.yml` (**required**): A file describing your submission, following the descriptions in `example/metadata.yml`.  
    - [ ] `regressor.py` (**required**): a Python file that defines your method, named appropriately. See [submission/feat-example/regressor.py](https://github.com/cavalab/srbench/blob/Competition2022/submission/feat-example/regressor.py) for complete documentation.  It contains:
        - [ ]  `est`: a sklearn-compatible `Regressor` object. 
        - [ ]  `model(est, X=None)`: a function that returns a [**sympy-compatible**](https://www.sympy.org) string specifying the final model. It can optionally take the training data as an input argument. See [guidance below](###-returning-a-sympy-compatible-model-string). 
        - [ ]  `eval_kwargs` (optional): a dictionary that can specify method-specific arguments to `evaluate_model.py`.
        
    - [ ] `LICENSE` *(optional)* A license file
    - [ ] `environment.yml` *(optional)*: a [conda environment file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) that specifies dependencies for your submission. 
    - [ ] `install.sh` *(optional)*: a bash script that installs your method. 
    - [ ] additional files *(optional)*: you may include a folder containing the code for your method in the submission. 

I have verified that:

- [ ] install scripts do not require sudo permissions. 
- [ ] if pulled remotely, the source code is a fixed version (i.e., rerunning `install.sh` shouldn't pulll a different version of the code when run multiple times.)
