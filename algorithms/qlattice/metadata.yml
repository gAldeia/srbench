description: | # anything you'd like here to describe the method.
  The QLattice is a supervised machine learning tool for symbolic regression, and is a technology developed by Abzu.
  It composes functions together to build mathematical models betweeen the inputs and output.
  The functions vary from elementary ones such as addition, multiplication and squaring, to more complex ones such as
  natural logarithm, exponential and tanh.

  The library that contains the QLattice and the means to interact with it is called Feyn.
